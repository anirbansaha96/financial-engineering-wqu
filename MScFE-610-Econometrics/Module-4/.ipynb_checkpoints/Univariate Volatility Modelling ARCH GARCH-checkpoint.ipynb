    "Autoregressive models can be developed for univariate time series data that is stationary. In time series where the variance is increasing in a systematic way, such as an increasing trend, this property of the series is called heteroskedasticity.\n",

    "When the variance of a time-series process is not consistent, to model the data, it becomes imperative to model the conditional expectation and conditional variance of the data generating process. This notebook deals with methods to model the volatility of a time series.\n",
