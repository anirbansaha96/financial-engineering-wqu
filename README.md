# MSc in Financial Engineering, WorldQuant University
I'm pursuing the online tuition-free course "Master of Science in Financial Engineering" at WorldQuant University. I wish to apply the transferable skills I learn from this course in my current role and grow in the field of Machine Learning. I am trying to find the perfect niche between Mathematics, Quantitative Finance and Machine Learning, learning how each of these contributes and enriches the other field.

I wish to work in a Quantitative Research-oriented role, and this course is a step in the right direction. If you have an opportunity that you think is perfect for me, let's connect at [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/saha-anirban8/) and discuss! 

This repository contains codes for some of the exercises. This mainly contains topics which I felt needed more clarification. For example, statistical concepts which are needed for Financial Engineering and Quantitative Analysis of Financial Markets.

If you find any errors or would like to add any other content, please feel free to raise an issue/ create a pull request.

If you wish to contribute, or you benefited from this repository reach out to me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/saha-anirban8/).
